## Cypress Testing
Cypress was implemented for E2E testing. To run tests:
- Fork this repository
- Run `git clone` 
- `cd` into the directory
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` and open [localhost](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
- `npm run cypress` will start Cypress and open up test window
- when finished, run `ctrl + c` to stop running local server
  
## Background
The goal of this project was to develop an application where experienced and beginner developers alike can explore new technologies and gain some basic understanding of them. In additon to this, it aims to motivate developers to take on their new basic knowledge of a technology and discover how it can become part of a large tech stack for their future projects. 

## Future Directions
- Implementing a search feature
- Allowing users to favorite certain technologies or tech stacks
- Allowing users to build/add their own custom tech stacks
